			<p>13 year old Brock Bud became the first human to consume a full order of wings(12) lathered in the Bagel's notorious Dragon's Venom sauce, just after the award was given to the sauce for being the "Most Dangerous BBQ Sauce." Brock did have to report to the hospital with intense stomach pain after eating all the wings, though he was released later that day. </p>

The store features T-Shirts, stuffed animals, blankets, and of course, the special Bagel's Sauces.</p>
